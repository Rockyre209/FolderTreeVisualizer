# 🌳 Folder Tree Visualizer – By Lorky The Trader

Ever wished you could *see* your folder's structure like a little map?  
This Python tool lets you **generate a full tree layout** of any folder you choose.  
It saves that structure to a `.txt` file and even **copies it to your clipboard**, if it's not too big.  
With just one click, you've got a full view of everything inside — neat, clean, and kissable 💋

## 🧁 Why I Made This

Sometimes we just need a **quick, visual look** at what’s inside a folder.  
As a dev, trader, or creator, I've often had to explain:
- What files are inside
- How projects are structured
- What goes where in a client’s folder

And honestly? Doing that manually is boring as hell 😩

So I made this tool — to **automate the boring part** and **make it cute** in the process.  
Because life is too short for ugly code, baby 💖
